	During the summer months, bike rentals tend to be at the highest since the weather is warm and people tend to spend their spare time outdoors, which is clearly reflected by the data and the bar chart above. In the month of August, a popular summer month, the most popular times were from **7 AM to 8 PM**.  

2. **Top Ending Locations**

	For a bike renting business to be effective there needs to be a clear understanding of areas within cities that have higher demand and where most of the bikes need to be allocated to ensure there is enough supply. The above visualization shows the **top ending locations** in NYC which reflects where the majority of the bikes were taken when they were checked out by the users.

## Summary 

This data analysis provides insightful information for investors into the demand for bike renting businesses in New York which can be implemented in cities like Des Moines. It's clear there is a high demand for bikes, regardless of gender and it appears to be a popular method of transportation be it for day-to-day needs to more touristic uses.

Based on the data set provided, I would have conducted an analysis of hours where bikes were used the least, to plan out the most ideal time slots for maintenance of the bikes across the stations to ensure bikes are always ready to be checked out without inconveniencing users and customers.

Another analysis that can be useful to conduct would be to take into consideration the distances transited by users, and with this information try to set up a more efficient plan for stations that allow for more reachability for all commutes.
